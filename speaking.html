<h1>So you're speaking at Chadev Lunch?</h1>
<h2>What you need to know</h2>
<p>First of all, we're so excited to have you, and thankful for the time you're investing in 
sharing with your community. There are a few details that will make your experience speaking with
us go as smooth as possible, so read on.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Our projection system is HDMI based</h3>
        <p>This includes audio, the only connection to your device will be through the supplied HDMI or Mini DisplayPort
        cables. If your device has a different display output, please bring the appropriate adapter with you or contact our team a few days in advance 
        so we can secure the correct adapter for you.
        If you have audio in your presentation, familiarize yourself with changing 
        the default audio device in your system preferences. Once connected to our system, the proper sound output device 
        will be identified as 'DECIMATOR'. You can read more about that for various OSes here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25370">Apple OSX</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-wu3hBS9pc">Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/312659/how-to-change-audio-outputs-on-a-chromebook/">ChromeOS</a>
        Also note, OSX devices cannot control volume of audio through the HDMI interface, so plan on arriving a few minutes early
        to test and allow us to adjust the system volume to an appropriate level for your content.
    </li>
    <li><h3>Our projection and live streaming system is optimized for 16:9 ratio and 1920x1080 resolution</h3>
    <p>While we will always do our best to accomodate you, your presentation will look best and make the most impact if you
    stick to these formats. If your devices' native resolution is other than the above, please familiarize yourself with adjusting 
    the secondary display resolution before arriving, to minimize stress. If you're unfamiliar with this process see OS 
    specific guides here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351">Apple OSX</a>,

    </li>
    <li><h3>Microphones</h3>
        <p>We use clip-on lavalier microphones for our speakers, we believe your experience as a speaker will be better if you're able
        to accomodate the lavalier, but a handheld mic is available if there is a technical difficulty. <a href="https://gabrielledolan.com/latest-posts/wearing/">Here</a>
        is a great post outlining some of the general considerations regarding apparel when speaking with a lavalier microphone. Though our space is not large, we do require a
        microphone, as the building systems generate a substantial amount of white noise near the rear of the room, and our live stream audience won't be able to hear you, no matter
        how well you project your voice.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Confidence Monitor</h3>
        <p>Your presentation will be displayed on a confidence monitor located in the upper right field of view from the podium, this will allow you to
        check your slides without turning your back to the audience. It may take some practice to use it effectively, but once accustomed, it's a nice feature that
        we're happy to be able to offer. This also will allow you to use speaker notes on your device screen while still having a large enough reference view of 
        the current slide.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Presentation Remote</h3>
        <p>We will have a Logitech Spotlight presentation remote available for your use, it allows slide forward and back as well as cursor movement through a 
        USB Receiver (USB-A) or Bluetooth. If you have diagrams or other detailed slides that you'd like to point out specifics in, we recommend 
        downloading the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote/page/spotlight-features">Logitech Spotlight Software Application</a>,
        this will allow you to effectively highlight details for both our live and streaming audiences. If needed, you can make use of the timer and other advanced features
        with that application as well.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
